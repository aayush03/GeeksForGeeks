/**
 * You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.
 *
 * For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:
 *
 * Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
 * Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
 * We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.
 *
 * Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.
 *
 * Return the final order of the logs.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
 * Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 0 <= logs.length <= 100
 * 3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
 * logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.
